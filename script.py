# # Describe Problem
# def my_function():
#   for i in range(1, 21):
#     if i == 20:
#       print("You got it")
# my_function()
# # range omits last number in range


# # Reproduce the Bug
# from random import randint
# dice_imgs = ["❶", "❷", "❸", "❹", "❺", "❻"]
# dice_num = randint(0, 5)
# print(dice_imgs[dice_num])
# # numbers to be randomly generated are for the index not the actual dice


# # Play Computer
# year = int(input("What's your year of birth?"))
# if year > 1980 and year < 1994:
#   print("You are a millenial.")
# elif year >= 1994:
#   print("You are a Gen Z.")
# # there is no equal for 1994

# # Fix the Errors
# age = int(input("How old are you?"))
# if age > 18:
#     print(f"You can drive at age {age}.")
# #indent error as well as need to have the input be an int. You also need an f string to include a variable value


# #Print is Your Friend
# pages = 0
# word_per_page = 0
# pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
# word_per_page = int(input("Number of words per page: "))
# total_words = pages * word_per_page
# print(total_words)
# # ==(equality) not good and needs to be =(assignment) instead
